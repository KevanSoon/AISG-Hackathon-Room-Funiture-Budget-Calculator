# AISG-Hackathon-Room-Funiture-Budget-Calculator
 
Hello there, thanks for viewing my AISG Hackathon Project!

To be able to run this Django application, you will need to setup a virtual environment and download the packages from requirements.txt.

I did not upload my virtual environment as PeekingDuck package is too heavy to be uploaded onto GitHub .
